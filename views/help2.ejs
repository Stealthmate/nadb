	This is the teams pane. You can insert a total of 6 characters in 2 teams.

	<br />
	You can see each character's avatar, as well as abilities.
	Above each ability's icon, there are icons for the classes which that ability is of. Hovering above a class icon will display a tooltip on the lower right side of the screen.

	Inside the ability icon, on the lower left side, you can see its cost. Again, hovering over a chakra cost will display a tooltip with its name on the lower right side of the screen.

	<br />
	You can select/deselect a member by clicking on the avatar slot (orange border) or by pressing one of the number buttons (1-6). Once a member is selected, any character that
	you try to insert will go in the selected member slot.
	<br />
	<br />
	Hovering over an ability icon will display details about the ability in the panel behind this text. Click an ability to lock the description.
